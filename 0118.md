I'm excited to announce that Kenneth Chenault, the outgoing CEO of American Express, has agreed to join Facebook's Board of Directors.
>我很高兴地宣布，即将卸任的美国运通公司首席执行官 肯尼斯·钱纳特（Kenneth Chenault） 已经同意加入脸书的董事会。

I've been trying to recruit Ken for years. He has unique expertise in areas I believe Facebook needs to learn and improve -- customer service, direct commerce, and building a trusted brand. Ken also has a strong sense of social mission and the perspective that comes from running an important public company for decades.
>这么多年我一直在努力招募肯。 他在脸书需要学习和提升的领域有着独特的专业知识，包括客户服务，直接交易和建立值得信赖的品牌。 肯也具有强烈的社会使命感和几十年来管理重要的上市公司带来的视角。

Adding someone to our board is one of the most important decisions our board makes. It's a long process that I take very seriously since this is the group that ultimately governs Facebook. Ken and I have had dinners discussing our mission and strategy for years, and he has already helped me think through some of the bigger issues I'm hoping we take on this year.
>增加一个人到我们的董事会是我们董事会做出的最重要的决定之一。 这是一个漫长的过程，我非常重视，因为这是最终管理脸书的的团体。 肯和我一起吃晚饭，讨论我们的使命和策略已经有好几年了，他已经帮助我思考了我今年希望我们做的一些比较大的问题。

Welcome Ken, and I'm looking forward to working with you on our board!
>欢迎肯，我期待着与您一起在我们的董事会工作！
