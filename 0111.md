Every year I take on a personal challenge to learn something new. I've visited every US state, run 365 miles, built an AI for my home, read 25 books, and learned Mandarin.
>每年我都要发起一个学习新鲜事物的个人挑战。我访问过美国的每一个州, 跑过 365 英里，为我的家建立过一个智能助手，读过 25 本书，并学习过普通话。

I started doing these challenges in 2009. That first year the economy was in a deep recession and Facebook was not yet profitable. We needed to get serious about making sure Facebook had a sustainable business model. It was a serious year, and I wore a tie every day as a reminder.
>我从 2009 年起开始了这些挑战。第一年经济严重衰退, 脸书还没有盈利。我们需要认真考虑确保脸书有一个可持续的业务模式。那是紧张的一年, 我每天都戴领带来提醒自己。

Today feels a lot like that first year. The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do -- whether it's protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent.
>今天我感觉和第一年很相似。世界在焦虑和分裂, 脸书还有很多工作要做--无论是保护我们的社区不被滥用和仇恨、抵御国家的干涉, 还是确保花在脸书上的时间是值得的。

My personal challenge for 2018 is to focus on fixing these important issues. We won't prevent all mistakes or abuse, but we currently make too many errors enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools. If we're successful this year then we'll end 2018 on a much better trajectory.
>我 2018 年的个人挑战是“关注解决这些重要问题”。尽管我们无法防止所有的错误或滥用, 但我们目前在执行我们的政策和防止滥用我们的工具方面犯了太多错误。如果今年我们成功了, 2018 年结束时我们就会在一个更好的轨道上。

This may not seem like a personal challenge on its face, but I think I'll learn more by focusing intensely on these issues than I would by doing something completely separate. These issues touch on questions of history, civics, political philosophy, media, government, and of course technology. I'm looking forward to bringing groups of experts together to discuss and help work through these topics.
>这似乎并不像个人的挑战, 但相比做一些完全独立的事情，我想我会从专注这些问题上学到更多。这些问题涉及历史、公民、政治哲学、媒体、政府，当然也包括技术。我期待着召集专家们一起讨论和帮助通过这些议题。

For example, one of the most interesting questions in technology right now is about centralization vs decentralization. A lot of us got into technology because we believe it can be a decentralizing force that puts more power in people's hands. (The first four words of Facebook's mission have always been "give people the power".) Back in the 1990s and 2000s, most people believed technology would be a decentralizing force.
>例如，目前技术上最有趣的问题之一是中心化与去中心化的对抗。我们很多人都迷恋技术，因为我们相信它能成为一股去中心化的力量，让我们把更多的权力给到人们手里。(脸书的第一个四字使命一直是 “给人力量”。) 回到 1990 年代和 2000 年代，大多数人相信技术将是一股去中心化的力量。

But today, many people have lost faith in that promise. With the rise of a small number of big tech companies — and governments using technology to watch their citizens — many people now believe technology only centralizes power rather than decentralizes it.
>但今天，许多人对这一承诺失去了信心。随着少数大型科技公司的崛起以及政府利用技术来监视他们的公民，相比去中心化很多人现在更相信技术让权力更集中。

There are important counter-trends to this --like encryption and cryptocurrency -- that take power from centralized systems and put it back into people's hands. But they come with the risk of being harder to control. I'm interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services.
>像加密技术和加密货币一样，有把权力从中心化的系统中交回人们手中的重要反趋势，但他们冒着更难控制的风险。我有兴趣深入研究这些技术的积极和消极方面, 以及如何在我们的服务中更好地使用这些技术.

This will be a serious year of self-improvement and I'm looking forward to learning from working to fix our issues together.
>这将是自我提升紧张的一年, 我期待着通过一起努力修复我们的问题上学到更多。
